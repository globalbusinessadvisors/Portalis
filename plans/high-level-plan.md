Project Plan: Python → Rust → WASM (Scripts and Libraries) with NVIDIA
1) Vision

Deliver an agentic, GPU-accelerated pipeline that can take any Python workload — from a single script to a full-scale library — and translate it into Rust, compile it into WASM/WASI (dependency-free), and package it as NIM microservices served through Triton.

This bridges the gap between Python prototyping and enterprise-scale, high-performance, portable deployment.

2) Outcomes

Rust Workspaces: Generated Rust code mirroring the Python codebase (scripts or libraries).

WASM Modules: Portable, dependency-free WASM binaries with WASI compatibility.

Testing & Validation: Automatic conformance tests, golden data vectors, and performance benchmarks.

Enterprise Packaging: Ready-to-deploy NIM services with Triton endpoints.

Omniverse Integration: WASM modules usable inside Omniverse simulations for real-world enterprise scenarios.

3) Modes of Operation

Script Mode:
Input a single Python file. Output: Rust crate → WASM module → NIM service. Great for rapid demo.

Library Mode:
Input a complete Python package/repo. Output: Multi-crate Rust workspace → WASM modules → packaged with conformance tests and parity reports.

Both modes are powered by the same agentic pipeline, simply scaled up for library-level complexity.

4) Agentic Pipeline

Ingest & Analyze Agents: Inspect the Python codebase, extract APIs, build dependency graphs, and capture IO contracts.

Spec Generator (NeMo): Transform the discovered API surface into formal Rust interfaces (types, traits, error contracts).

Transpiler Agents: Generate Rust implementations for functions/classes and design WASI-compatible ABIs for WASM outputs.

CUDA-Accelerated Engines: Use GPU parallelism for AST parsing, embedding similarity checks, translation re-ranking, and test case prioritization.

Build & Test Agents: Assemble Rust workspaces, translate test suites, generate property-based tests, and run performance benchmarks.

Packaging Agents: Compile to WASM, create NIM containers, register endpoints in Triton, and prepare Omniverse-compatible modules.

5) NVIDIA Integration

NeMo → Language models for structured Python → Rust translation.

CUDA → Acceleration of parsing, embeddings, and verification tasks.

Triton → Deployment at scale for batch and interactive translation jobs.

NIM → Portable, enterprise-ready microservices for delivery.

DGX Cloud → Scales the workflow across larger libraries and workloads.

Omniverse → Demonstrates portability in simulation and industrial use cases.

6) High-Level Workflow

Input: Python script or full library.

Analysis: Extract APIs, contracts, and dependencies.

Spec Generation: NeMo produces structured Rust targets.

Translation: Agents generate Rust, optimized via CUDA scoring.

Compilation: Rust → WASM/WASI.

Validation: Run conformance tests and performance benchmarks.

Packaging: Build NIM services, serve via Triton.

Deployment: WASM microservices can run in cloud, edge, or Omniverse.

7) Success Criteria

Script Mode: Demonstrate end-to-end conversion of one or more scripts into validated, deployable WASM modules.

Library Mode: Demonstrate partial-to-full coverage of a real library with API parity reporting, validated tests, and measurable performance improvements.

Enterprise Fit: NIM-packaged services running through Triton, deployable at enterprise scale.

8) Risks & Mitigations

Dynamic Python Semantics → Mitigated by API surface analysis, runtime tracing, and explicit Rust type synthesis.

Complex Dependencies (any library) → Mitigated by modular translation (multi-crate workspaces) and WASI ABI mapping.

Performance Parity → Validated with benchmarks and GPU-accelerated optimization.

Numerical/Logic Differences → Golden tests and tolerance bands ensure correctness.
