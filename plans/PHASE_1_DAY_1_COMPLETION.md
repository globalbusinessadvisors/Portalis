### 4. Coverage Baseline ✅

**File**: `tests/python-features/coverage_baseline.json`

**Initial Metrics**:
```json
{
  "total_tests": 590,
  "by_complexity": {
    "Low": 255,
    "Medium": 179,
    "High": 96,
    "Very": 60
  },
  "by_status": {
    "not_implemented": 590,
    "partial": 0,
    "implemented": 0,
    "unsupported": 0
  },
  "by_category": {
    "basic-syntax": {"total": 38, "not_implemented": 38},
    "operators": {"total": 48, "not_implemented": 48},
    ...
  }
}
```

**Current Coverage**: 0.0% (expected - translation not yet implemented)

---

## Technical Details

### Test File Format

Each test file follows a consistent structure:

```python
"""
Feature: Simple Assignment
Category: Basic Syntax
Complexity: Low
Status: not_implemented
"""

import pytest

PYTHON_SOURCE = '''
x = 42
y = "hello"
'''

EXPECTED_RUST = '''
let x: i32 = 42;
let y: &str = "hello";
'''

@pytest.mark.complexity("low")
@pytest.mark.status("not_implemented")
def test_simple_assignment():
    """Test translation of simple variable assignments."""
    pytest.skip("Feature not yet implemented")
```

### Pytest Markers

- **Complexity**: `complexity_low`, `complexity_medium`, `complexity_high`, `complexity_very_high`
- **Status**: `status_not_implemented`, `status_partial`, `status_implemented`, `status_unsupported`

### Coverage Tracking

The infrastructure automatically tracks:
- Total features
- Implemented vs. not implemented
- Coverage by complexity level
- Coverage by category
- Implementation progress over time

## Metrics

### Lines of Code Created

| Component | Lines | Files |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Feature Catalog | 1,882 | 1 |
| Test Files | ~17,700 (590 × 30 avg) | 590 |
| Infrastructure | ~800 | 6 |
| **Total** | **~20,382** | **597** |

### Complexity Analysis

Based on the 527-feature catalog:

| Complexity | Features | Percentage | Est. Days | Est. Person-Days |
|------------|----------|------------|-----------|------------------|
| Low | 241 | 45.7% | 12 days | 24 |
| Medium | 159 | 30.2% | 16 days | 48 |
| High | 91 | 17.3% | 18 days | 91 |
| Very High | 36 | 6.8% | 18 days | 144 |
| **Total** | **527** | **100%** | **64 days** | **307** |

**Team Size Required**: 5-6 engineers for 16-week completion

---

## Unsupported Features Identified

Through the cataloging process, 36 features were identified as Very High complexity or impossible to translate:

### Fundamentally Incompatible
1. **Dynamic Execution**: `eval()`, `exec()`, `compile()`
2. **Runtime Introspection**: `globals()`, `locals()`, `vars()`
3. **Dynamic Imports**: `__import__()` with runtime paths
4. **Attribute Magic**: Extensive `__getattr__`, `__setattr__` usage

### Requires Runtime Interpreter
5. **Metaclass Magic**: Complex metaclass hierarchies
6. **Descriptor Protocol**: Advanced descriptor usage
7. **Dynamic Type Creation**: `type()` as constructor
8. **Monkey Patching**: Runtime attribute injection

**Recommendation**: Document unsupported patterns, provide migration guides

## Next Steps (Day 2)

According to the Phase 1 Week 1 schedule:

### Day 2 Tasks (8 hours)
1. ✅ Complete feature inventory (already done)
2. ⏳ **Begin translator core implementation**
   - Set up Rust project structure

   - Implement basic type inference
   - Create first translator pass (literals, simple assignments)

3. ⏳ **Implement 10 Low complexity features**
   - Integer literals
   - Float literals
   - String literals
   - Boolean literals
   - Simple assignment
   - Multiple assignment
   - Augmented assignment
   - Print statements
   - Comments
   - Docstrings

4. ⏳ **Run first coverage test**
   - Execute test suite
   - Generate coverage report
   - Target: 2% coverage (10/527 features)

**Estimated Hours**: 8 hours
- Core setup: 3 hours
- Feature implementation: 4 hours
- Testing & validation: 1 hour
