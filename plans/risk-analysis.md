## 7. Risk Mitigation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
**Focus**: Address critical risks early

- **T1 (Dynamic Semantics)**: Implement type inference and runtime tracing
- **T3 (Dependencies)**: Build dependency classification and mapping
- **T2 (Stdlib)**: Implement core stdlib compatibility layer
- **O1 (Testing)**: Establish test translation framework

### Phase 2: Expansion (Months 4-6)
**Focus**: Broaden capability and harden quality

- **T5 (Memory)**: Refine ownership patterns
- **T7 (WASM ABI)**: Finalize ABI design
- **P1 (Performance)**: Establish benchmarking and optimization
- **I1 (NeMo)**: Validate model quality and fallbacks

### Phase 3: Hardening (Months 7-9)
**Focus**: Production readiness

- **O4 (Security)**: Security audit and hardening
- **O5 (Licensing)**: Legal review and compliance
- **I2 (Triton)**: Production deployment automation

- Stakeholder communication
- Timeline and scope adjustment
- Lessons learned

### 8.2 Risk Ownership

| Risk Category | Primary Owner | Escalation Path |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Technical | Tech Lead | Engineering Director |
| Integration | Integration Team Lead | Product Director |
| Performance | Performance Engineer | CTO |
| Operational | Engineering Manager | VP Engineering |
| Security | Security Lead | CISO |
| Legal/IP | Legal Liaison | General Counsel |

### 8.3 Risk Communication

**Internal Communication**:

- Weekly risk summary email
- Monthly all-hands risk section
- Quarterly risk report

**Stakeholder Communication**:
- Monthly executive briefing
- Quarterly board update
- Critical risk immediate escalation
- Mitigation success stories

## 9. Success Criteria for Risk Management

The risk management program is successful if:

1. **No Surprise Failures**: All critical issues were identified in advance
2. **Mitigation Effectiveness**: ≥80% of identified risks successfully mitigated
3. **Early Detection**: Risks detected in early warning phase (yellow flags)
4. **Responsive Adaptation**: Contingency plans activated within 1 week of trigger
5. **Stakeholder Confidence**: Transparent communication builds trust
6. **Project Success**: Project delivers on goals within acceptable variance

---

## 10. Conclusion

This risk analysis identifies 22 distinct risks across technical, integration, performance, and operational categories. The highest-priority risks center on Python's dynamic semantics translation, third-party dependency handling, and maintaining performance parity.

The mitigation strategies emphasize:
- **Layered approaches**: Multiple techniques to address each risk
- **Early action**: Critical risks addressed in Phase 1
- **Measurable outcomes**: Clear success metrics for each mitigation
- **Contingency readiness**: Backup plans for high-impact risks

By proactively managing these risks with continuous monitoring and adaptive responses, the project can successfully deliver a robust Python→Rust→WASM translation platform that meets enterprise requirements.
