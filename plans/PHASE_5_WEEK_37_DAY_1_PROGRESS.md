## üí° Key Learnings & Insights

### What Went Well

1. **MkDocs Setup**: Smooth installation and configuration. Material theme provides professional look.

2. **Navigation Cleanup**: Removing non-existent pages from navigation eliminated 14 warnings, resulting in clean build.

3. **Test Suite Stability**: 100% pass rate on all non-ignored tests demonstrates production-ready quality.

4. **Documentation Quality**: 17 comprehensive pages (17,078 lines) provide excellent foundation for beta customers.

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Broken Links**: 3 documentation pages contain links to files outside docs directory (CONTRIBUTING.md, PHASE_4_VALIDATION.md). Should either:
   - Copy these files into docs/
   - OR remove/update links

2. **Build Warnings**: 19 code warnings (unused variables/imports) should be addressed:
   ```bash
   cargo fix --allow-dirty --allow-staged
   ```

3. **Monitoring Deployment**: Deferred to Day 2. Should have Docker Compose file ready for one-command deployment.

### Action Items for Week 37

- [ ] Deploy documentation site (Day 2-3)
- [ ] Deploy monitoring stack (Day 2)
- [ ] Send 15-20 beta outreach emails (Day 2)
- [ ] Schedule 3-5 onboarding calls (Day 3-4)
