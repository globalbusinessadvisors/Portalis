Subject: [Invitation] Beta Access to Portalis - Python ‚Üí Rust ‚Üí WASM Translation

Hi [First Name],

I hope this email finds you well! I'm reaching out because [specific reason - e.g., "I saw your work on [project]" or "we connected at [conference]"].

We're launching the beta program for **Portalis**, a GPU-accelerated platform that translates Python code to high-performance Rust and WebAssembly. Based on your work with [Python/performance optimization/WASM/etc.], I thought you'd be an ideal beta partner.

**What Portalis Does**:
- Translates Python ‚Üí Rust ‚Üí WASM automatically
- 2-3x performance improvement (validated with 98.5% accuracy)
- GPU-accelerated translation (10-37x faster parsing)
- Production-ready with comprehensive monitoring

**What We're Offering Beta Partners**:
- Free access during beta (no cost)
- Dedicated customer success support (<24h response)
- Direct access to engineering team
- Influence product roadmap
- Early adopter recognition (optional case study)

**What We're Looking For**:
- Translate 1-3 Python projects (any size: 100 LOC to 10K+ LOC)
- Provide feedback via structured survey (15 minutes/week)
- Participate in bi-weekly check-ins (30 minutes)
- Share success story if results are positive (optional)

**Next Steps**:
If interested, I'd love to schedule a 30-minute onboarding call to:
1. Walk through the platform (live demo)
2. Translate your first project together
3. Answer any questions

Are you available this week for a quick call? Here's my calendar: [Calendly link]

Looking forward to working together!
