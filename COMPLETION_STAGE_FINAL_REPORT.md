## Technical Debt Management

### Current Technical Debt

**High Priority Debt**:
1. Regex parser (to be replaced Week 1)
2. Basic type inference (to be enhanced Weeks 1-2)
3. Template-based codegen (to be generalized Week 2)
4. Missing Rust tests (to be added Week 0)

**Medium Priority Debt**:
1. Limited error messages
2. No caching mechanism
3. Single-file constraint
4. No class support

**Low Priority Debt**:
1. CLI lacks color output
2. No configuration file
3. Limited profiling
4. Minimal documentation

### Debt Reduction Strategy

**Phase 0**: Address all high-priority debt
**Phase 1**: Address medium-priority debt (multi-file, classes)
**Phase 2**: Address low-priority debt (UX improvements)
**Phase 3**: Maintain low debt through gates
**Phase 4**: Zero critical debt for production
